### HW AVL: Life is all about balance

This assignment is on designing a fast data structure for range queries of words. The main CS objective
is to learn about AVL trees and understanding the power of augmented BSTs.

### Assignment details

Here are the relevant files and directories.

**range_queries_avl.pdf**: A pdf with the assignment description. Please read that first!

**Wordrange/**: This folder contains the files for your submission. You must write your code in this folder. Your Makefile
must be in this directory, and should create the executable "wordrange" in this directory. Here is a description of files
within this directory.

* simple-input.txt, simple-output.txt: These are test input files, to check your code. Please leave these files in this directory.
The checking script with check whether your output (for simple-input.txt) matches this output.
* Tests/: This contains a number of test input output files. Each output file has ``output" in its name.
* The Tests/ folder contains an extra copy of simple-input.txt and simple-output.txt, if you accidentally overwrite them.

**Do not delete any of files in the Tests directory!**

**checkcode.sh**: *This is very important!* This is a script to do some basic checks on your solution. You can run it as "./checkcode.sh", in terminal (while you're in the workspace folder). I recommend that you keep a separate terminal open, where you only run this command.  The command produces console output that explains the checks. If it finally ends with "PASS", this means your solution passed the tests. This does not guarantee that your code is correct, or that you will get any points. But if your code does not pass the test, you will not get any points when you submit. To ensure that the scripts runs properly, it is best to delete your executable and object files (*.o) files from the Wordrange/ directory. This ensures that this script will regenerate the executable, to check for any errors in compiling. Ideally, you should define a "clean" rule, so that the command "make clean" deletes the object and executable files.

**README.md**: That is the file you're reading right now :) You can click on this file, to get a tab with this. Again, keep this open for your convenience.

**RoboGrader/**: This has my checking and testing scripts. Do not modify anything here!

### Coding

Ideally, you should code directly through the command line, using an editor like vi or vim. Alternately, you can upload files directly. Go to the File menu, and click on "Upload".  But pleae compile your codes through the command line, and make sure everything runs in the Codio box. There is no guarantee that code compiled on your machine works on the Codio box (often, because of incompatible OSes or text editors introducing strange symbols, etc.) We will be testing your code directly in the Codio box, so ensure that you compile codes here.  Please use the checkcode.sh script to ensure everything is running. A significant part of grading is automated, so it is essential that you follow these rules.
  
Even if you're not familiar with Unix, I highly recommend sticking to the command line. You will get better at it, and it will help you greatly in the long run.
