HW2: nqueens without recursion
The Files contains two function for solving NQueens problem, wher both do get diffrent results, they both do solve the NQueens problem.
The Recursive Function was refenced by other sites and a videos online explaing the implemtaion for NQueens recursive function. 
I modified the recusive function and isAttacking function to consider pre-existing queens on the board. 
The Stack Implemtaiton of the NQueens was inpired by Prof. Seshadhri implemtaion on the recursion code with stacks.

USAGE:  (the executable is generated by a Makefile)
    ./NQueens <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>

    Only the first line of <INPUT FILE> is read, as a string. <OUTPUT FILE> contains all subsequences, each in a separate line.
