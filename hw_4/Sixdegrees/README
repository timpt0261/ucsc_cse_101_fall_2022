Assigment 4 : Six degrees of Kevin Bacon

This file contain my implentation of the Bredth Firt Search. The code for the Graph
class was influnced by the resources below. Where the graph had an Interger V, 
that represented the number of Vertcies in the graph, a Set to reprsent all the Vertices 
in the graph, and a unordered_map to reprsent the adjcent neighbors of each vertice.
Along with four function: addEdge, find_adj, reconstructed, and bfs. Both BFS
and Reconstructed were function inspired by the refrences below, and idealy one was to 
implemetnt the search while the other recreates the path between the star and end node.
The addEdge works to simply create the Graph, the find_adj is just a helper function 
to list out all the movie name between actors. 

USAGE:  (the executable is generated by a Makefile)
    ./sixdegrees <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>
    Only the first line of <INPUT FILE> is read, as a string. <OUTPUT FILE> contains all subsequences, each in a separate line.
